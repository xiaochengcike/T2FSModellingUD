The "bank" family of datasets are generated from a simplistic simulator, which
simulates the queues in a series of banks. The simulator was constructed with
the explicit purpose of generating a family of datasets for DELVE.

Customers come from several residential areas, chose their prefered bank
depending on distances and have tasks of varying complexity, and various
levels of patience. Each bank has several queues, that open and close
according to demand. The tellers have various effectivities, and customers
may change queue, if their patience expires. In the "rej" prototasks, the
object is to predict the rate of rejections, ie the fraction of customers
that are turned away from the bank because all the open tellers have full
queues.
